        <h2>How Loan Payments Are Calculated</h2>
        <p>
            Loan payments are calculated using a standard amortization formula that
            considers the loan amount, interest rate and loan term.
        </p>

        <h2>Loan Payment Formula</h2>
        <p>
            Monthly Payment = P × [ r(1+r)^n ] ÷ [ (1+r)^n − 1 ]
        </p>
        <p>
            Where P is the loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate,
            and n is the total number of payments.
        </p>
